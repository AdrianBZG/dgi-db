        The 14th annual Advances in Genome Biology and Technology (AGBT) meeting was held in Marco Island, Florida, on February 20-23, 2013.  A poster describing DGIdb was present by Obi Griffith and results from DGIdb were described during a talk delivered by Malachi Griffith in the Genomic Medicine session. The first publicly available release of DGIdb includes 2 sources of canonical gene information, 1 source of drug information, 5 sources of drug-gene interactions and 4 sources of potentially druggable gene categories.

    - headline: MyCancerGenome is added as a source for DGIdb
      article: > 
        Highly curated drug-gene interactions have been mined from <a href="http://www.mycancergenome.org/">MyCancerGenome</a> and incorporated into DGIdb. My Cancer Genome is a freely available online personalized cancer medicine resource and decision-making tool for physicians, patients, caregivers and researchers.  From this resource we obtained 835 drug-gene interactions involving 169 genes and 226 drugs.
