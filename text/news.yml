    - headline: DGIdb beta is launched at AGBT 2013
      article: >
        The 14th annual Advances in Genome Biology and Technology (AGBT) meeting was held in Marco Island, Florida, on February 20-23, 2013. 
        A poster describing DGIdb was presented by Obi Griffith and results from DGIdb were described during a talk delivered by Malachi Griffith 
        in the Genomic Medicine session. The first publicly available release of DGIdb includes 2 sources of canonical gene information, 
        1 source of drug information, 5 sources of drug-gene interactions and 4 sources of potentially druggable gene categories.

    - headline: MyCancerGenome is added as a source for DGIdb
      article: > 
        Highly curated drug-gene interactions have been mined from <a href="http://www.mycancergenome.org/">My Cancer Genome</a> and incorporated 
        into DGIdb. My Cancer Genome is a freely available online personalized cancer medicine resource and decision-making tool for physicians, 
        patients, caregivers and researchers.  From this resource we obtained 835 drug-gene interactions involving 169 genes and 226 drugs.

    - headline: Updated version of the interface is released
      article: > 
        Many improvements and fixes have been incorporated into DGIdb.  
        API access has been added along with detailed documentation and examples (see Help -> <a href="http://dgidb.genome.wustl.edu/api">API Documentation</a>). 
        TSV export functionality has been improved.
        Results are now characterized by source trust level and results can now be filtered on this attribute.
        Extensive documentation was added throughout various views in the form of additional help flags.

    - headline: Cancer Commons is added as a source for DGIdb
      article: >
        Highly curated drug-gene interactions have been mined from <a href="http://www.cancercommons.org/">Cancer Commons</a> and incorporated 
        into DGIdb. Cancer Commons is a patient-centered nonprofit uniting patients, clinicians, and researchers in rapid learning communities.
        From this resource we obtained 109 drug-gene interactions involving 48 genes and 80 drugs.

    - headline: Clearity Foundation is added as a source for DGIdb
      article: >
        Highly curated drug-gene interactions have been mined from <a href="https://www.clearityfoundation.org/">the Clearity Foundation</a> and
        incorporated into DGIdb. The Clearity Foundation is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization that provides patient support services including
        lab test coordination, tumor blueprint interpretation, and clinical trial identification free of charge. The Clearity Foundation was launched 
        in 2008 to help ovarian cancer patients and their physicians make better-informed treatment decisions, based on molecular profiling of tumors.
        From this resource we obtained 175 drug-gene interactions involving 34 genes and 64 drugs.
