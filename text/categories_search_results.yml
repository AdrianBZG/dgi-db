categories_search_results:
  title_main: Category Search Results
  title_small: druggable categories for your genes
  definite_results_passed_filter_flag: >
    Primary results passed all filters and the search term unambiguously matched a single gene belonging to druggable gene categories
  ambiguous_terms_flag: Your search term matched more than one gene record.
  no_matches_flag: Search terms for which we could find no matches
  category_table_header_flag: Categories are groups of genes considered by some to be potentially druggable targets.
  gene_table_header_flag: Gene Name within DGIDB that matched your search term (either directly or through a synonym)
  search_term_table_header_flag: The search term you entered
  source_table_header_flag: All of the soures in the row report that gene as being a member of the listed category. Green sources are classified as expert curated while yellow sources are non-curated.
  terms_with_no_matches_flag: Search term for which we could find no matches, not even to an alias of any gene known to DGIdb.
  search_results_summary_flag: >
    The following basic statistics relate to the outcome of attempting to match
    genes supplied by the user with gene identities in DGIdb.
  search_results_by_categories_flag: >
    The number of search terms matching genes in each potentially druggable gene category are 
    displayed along with the identies of genes belonging to those categories.
  search_results_by_source: >
     The number of search terms matching genes in each potentially druggable gene category are 
     broken down by the source of the gene category information.
