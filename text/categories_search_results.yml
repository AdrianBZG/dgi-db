    Category Search Results
  title_small: >
    Druggable categories for your genes
  title_search_results_by_source: >
    The number of search terms matching genes in each potentially druggable gene category are broken down 
    by the source of the gene category information.  
  definite_results_passed_filter_flag: >
    Primary results passed all filters and the search term unambiguously matched a single gene belonging 
    to druggable gene categories.
  ambiguous_terms_flag: >
    Your search term matched more than one gene record.
  no_matches_flag: >
    Search terms for which we could find no matches.
  category_table_header_flag: >
    Categories are groups of genes considered by some to be potentially druggable targets.
  gene_table_header_flag: >
    Gene Name within DGIDB that matched your search term (either directly or through a synonym).
  search_term_table_header_flag: >
    The search term you entered.
  source_table_header_flag: >
    Sources that report this gene as being a member of the listed category. Green sources are classified as 
    expert curated while yellow sources are non-curated.
  terms_with_no_matches_flag: >
    Search term for which we could find no matches, not even to an alias of any gene known to DGIdb.
  search_results_summary_flag: >
    The following basic statistics relate to the outcome of attempting to match genes supplied by the user 
    with gene identities in DGIdb.
  search_results_by_categories_flag: >
    The number of search terms matching genes in each potentially druggable gene category are displayed along 
    with the identities of genes belonging to those categories.
