  title_main: Interaction Search Results
  title_small: interaction results for your entered gene names
  definite_results_passed_filter_flag: >
    Definite results that passed the filter are those where the provided
    search term unambiguously matched a single gene record with known
    interactions meeting the specified filter criteria
  definite_results_failed_filter_flag: >
    Definite results that passed the filter are those where the provided
    search term unambiguously matched a single gene record with known interactions
    that did not meet the specified filter criteria
  ambiguous_results_passed_filter_flag: >
    Ambiguous results are those where the provided search term matched
    more than one gene record of which at least one had known drug interactions
    meeting the specifed filter criteria. In other words - we are not able to positively
    identify which gene you meant. To avoid this issue please use the
    official gene names provided by Entrez Gene.
  ambiguous_results_failed_filter_flag: >
    Ambiguous results are those where the provided search term matched more
    than one gene record of which at least one had known drug interactions that
    did not meet the specifed filter criteria. In other words - we are not able
    to positively identify which gene you meant. To avoid this issue please use
    the official gene names provided by Entrez Gene.
  ambiguous_results_no_interactions_flag: >
    Your search term matched more than one gene record - none of which had any
    interactions in any source regardless of any filtering criteria you selected
  definite_results_no_interactions_flag: >
    Search term was matched definitely but had no interactions in any data source regardless of any filtering criteria
  terms_with_no_matches_flag: Search terms for which we could find no matches
  gene_table_header: Gene Name within DGIDB which matched your search term (either directory or through a synonym)
  interaction_table_header: Interaction Types are used to categorize the nature of drug-gene interactions (e.g. mechanism) and vary by source.
