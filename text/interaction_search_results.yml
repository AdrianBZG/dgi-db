  title_main: Interaction Search Results
  title_small: drug interactions for your genes
  definite_results_passed_filter_flag: >
    Primary results passed all filters and the search term unambiguously 
    matched a single gene with known drug interactions.
  definite_results_failed_filter_flag: >
    Definite results that passed the filter are those where the provided
    search term unambiguously matched a single gene record with known interactions
    that did not meet the specified filter criteria.
  ambiguous_results_passed_filter_flag: >
    Ambiguous results are those where the provided search term matched
    more than one gene record of which at least one had known drug interactions
    meeting the specifed filter criteria. In other words - we are not able to positively
    identify which gene you meant. To avoid this issue please use the
    official gene names provided by Entrez Gene.
  ambiguous_results_failed_filter_flag: >
    Ambiguous results are those where the provided search term matched more
    than one gene record of which at least one had known drug interactions that
    did not meet the specifed filter criteria. In other words - we are not able
    to positively identify which gene you meant. To avoid this issue please use
    the official gene names provided by Entrez Gene.
  ambiguous_results_no_interactions_flag: >
    Your search term matched more than one gene record - none of which had any
    interactions in any source regardless of any filtering criteria you selected.
  definite_results_no_interactions_flag: >
    Search term was matched definitely but had no interactions in any 
    data source regardless of any filtering criteria.
  terms_with_no_matches_flag: Search terms for which we could find no matches
  gene_table_header_flag: Gene Name within DGIDB that matched your search term (either directly or through a synonym)
  interaction_table_header_flag: Interaction Types are used to categorize the nature of drug-gene interactions (e.g. mechanism) and vary by source.
  search_term_table_header_flag: The search term you entered
  drug_table_header_flag: Drug name as reported by original source. The link will take you to a complete record of information relating to this drug from that source.
  source_table_header_flag: An abbreviated name for the source of this drug-gene interaction. The link will provide a report and citation for that source. Green sources are classified as expert curated while yellow sources are non-curated.
  source_type_table_header_flag: Sources are bucketed into source types based on their level of curation and assumed accuracy
  search_term_summary_table_header_match_flag: >
     Match Type for your Search Terms may be ‘None’, ‘Ambiguous’, or ‘Definite’. ‘None’ means the gene did not match any primary or secondary
     gene names in DGIdb. ‘Ambiguous’ means multiple matches were found. ‘Definite’ means a single matching gene name was found.
  search_term_summary_table_header_matches_flag: >
     Genes in DGIdb that match this Search Term. ‘Definite’ matches should only have one entry here while ‘Ambiguous’ matches will have more than one.
  interaction_by_gene_table_header_distinct_drug_count_flag: >
     The number of distinct drugs that interact with each gene.
  interaction_by_gene_table_header_druggable_categories_flag: >
     The potentially druggable gene categories that each gene belongs to.
  interaction_by_source_table_header_interaction_flag: >
     A specific drug-gene interaction is displayed as (‘drug name’ and ‘gene name’). The following
     columns indicate which sources support an interaction between this drug and gene.
  interaction_by_source_table_header_count_flag: >
     The number of independant sources that support a particular drug-gene interaction claim.
