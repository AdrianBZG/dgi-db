  description: This page provides answers to a wide array of general questions. For detailed tutorials on how to use DGIdb, see the tutorials under the "Getting started" section of the help menu.
  questions:
    - question: How do I cite DGIdb?
      answer: >
        A manuscript describing DGIdb is currently under preparation.
        Once accepted for publication, citation details will appear here.
        Until then, please simply cite the URL for dgidb.org.
    - question: Where can I find the code base for DGIdb?
      answer: >
        The code for DGIdb is available at <a href="https://github.com/genome/dgi-db">github</a><i class="icon-share"></i>.
        Refer to the Downloads section for more details.
    - question: I have a source of druggable genes or drug-gene interactions that I would like to add to DGIdb. How do I do that?
      answer: >
        This is an open source project and you could therefore create your own instance with your own data ... but if you want that source
        we probably do also. Contact us and we will be happy to consider adding your source for you.
    - question: What is the goal of DGIdb?
      answer: >
        To help you annotate your genes of interest with respect to known drug-gene interactions and potential druggability.
    - question: What is the difference between a drug-gene interaction and druggable gene category?
      answer: >
        A drug-gene interaction is a known interaction (e.g. inhibition) between a known drug compound (e.g. lapatinib) and a target gene
        (e.g. EGFR). A druggable gene category is a grouping of genes that are thought to be potentially druggable by various methods of 
        prediction. For example, the 'rule-of-five' analysis described by Hopkins and Groom in 2002 defined lists of genes that were most
        likely to be successfully targeted by small molecule inhibitors. Genes in these categories are *potentially druggable* and 
        may or may not have existing drugs that target them. On the other hand, all of the genes from the drug-gene interaction sources 
        are targeted by specific known compounds.
    - question: How is this application different from DrugBank or TTD?
      answer: >
        There are many differences. DGIdb is limited to human genes only. DrugBank and TTD are databases that catalogue drugs and store
        detailed information about those drugs and the genes they target. DGIdb aggregates many such databases into a common framework.
        DGIdb adds considerable functionality for efficiently searching a list of input genes against these sources. DGIdb integrates both
        known drug-gene interactions and potentially druggable gene data. DGIdb allows the user refine their query to certain gene families,
        types of interactions, classes of drugs, etc.  DGIdb is open source and available in a format that would allow you to create your own
        instance. DGIdb incorporates sources of drug-gene interaction data that were previously only available in inaccessible formats (e.g.
        tables in a PDF document). DGIdb is meant to be used in combination with the original sources of raw data. Wherever possible we link
        out to those original sources.
    - question: How is DGIdb implemented?
      answer: >
        The web interface uses Ruby on Rails and Twitter bootstrap. The backend is a Postgres database. The importers that process data
        from each source and populate this database are written in object oriented Perl.
    - question: I found a gene in a category does not really belong there or a drug-gene interaction that appears false.  Should I report it?
      answer: >  
        We are working on udpates to the interface that would allows us to readily capture this kind of information. In the meantime please
        feel free to report it to us but the quality of our data is only as good as the sources of raw data. Throughout the results you will
        be able to see if multiple independant sources report the same findings using this as a filter may help you disqualify some spurious 
        entries and have increased confidence in others.
